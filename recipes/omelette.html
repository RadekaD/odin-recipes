    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A true French omelette, or omelet as we Americans call it, is just eggs and butter, no filling. The egg is folded for a soft, tender texture. It's 10% ingredients and 90% technique, so it does take a bit of practice to perfect.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 large fresh eggs</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon cold water</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne or white pepper to taste (Optional)</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk together oil, soy sauce, vinegar, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, Dijon mustard, garlic, and pepper for marinade in a 9x13-inch glass baking dish until thoroughly combined.</li>
        <li>Add flank steak to the baking dish; turn several times to coat thoroughly with marinade. Cover, and refrigerate for 2 to 6 hours, or up to 12 hours if you have time.</li>
        <li>Make the ricotta mixture.</li>
        <li>When ready to cook, preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Remove steak from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade.</li>
        <li>Cook steak on the preheated grill for about 5 minutes per side, or to desired doneness.</li>
        <li>Remove from the grill and let rest for 5 minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
    </ol>
